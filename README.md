# Temperature Converter

This project is a simple HTML, CSS, and JavaScript implementation of a temperature converter. The web application allows users to convert temperatures between Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin. The user can input a value in any of the temperature scales, and the corresponding values in the other two scales will be dynamically updated.

## 1. Project Overview

The Temperature Converter project provides a simple and user-friendly interface for converting temperatures among Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin. It utilizes HTML for the structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for dynamic conversions.

## 2. Getting Started

To view the project, follow these steps:

- Download or clone the repository.
- Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.

## 3. HTML Structure

The HTML file (`index.html`) includes the basic structure of the temperature converter interface. It consists of three input fields for Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin, along with a reset button. The necessary HTML elements are appropriately labeled and organized.

## 4. CSS Styling

The CSS file (`css/style.css`) contains the styles for the temperature converter. It provides a clean and responsive layout, ensuring a visually appealing design. The styling includes font styles, spacing, and alignment for a better user experience.

## 5. JavaScript Logic

The JavaScript file (`JS/script.js`) handles the dynamic conversion logic. It includes functions (`cel()`, `fah()`, `kel()`, and `res()`) that are triggered on input or reset. These functions perform the temperature conversions and update the corresponding input fields accordingly.

## 6. Additional Information

- **Responsive Design:** The project is designed to be responsive to various screen sizes, ensuring a consistent and user-friendly experience on different devices.

- **Reset Functionality:** The reset button (`#reset2`) is implemented to clear all input fields when clicked, providing a convenient way for users to start fresh.

Feel free to customize the code, styling, or add additional features as needed. If you have any questions or need further assistance, refer to the comments in the JavaScript file or reach out for support.
